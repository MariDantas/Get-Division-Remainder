# Get Division Remainder By 2
<br>

## Description
**Get Division Remainder By 2** is a straightforward project that helps you calculate the remainder when dividing a number by 2. Initially, the project features a function named ```getDivisionRemainderBy2()``` which calculates the division remainder and displays the result below the text box with the message "Division remainder by 2 is [remainder]."

The project has been enhanced by replacing the ```getDivisionRemainderBy2()``` funcion with the ```evenOrOdd()``` function. This updated version calculates the division remainder and uses it to determine whether the number is even or odd. The result is displayed in bold text below the text box with the message "Even or odd? [result]."

## Executing the Project
As this project doesn't use the HTTP protocol and requires running on a local server due to the presence of modules, follow these steps for execution:
1. **Download and install Visual Studio Code**: If you don't have it already, download and install Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor available for multiple platforms.
2. **Install the "Live Server" extension**:  In Visual Studio Code, click the gear icon and select "Extensions" from the dropdown menu. In the search box, type "Live Server" and select it from the search results to install the extension. This extension will be used to serve the project locally.
3. **Open the project folder**: After installing the "Live Server" extension, open Visual Studio Code and click the "Open Folder" button in the "Explorer" tab. Select the folder containing the "Get Division Remainder By 2" project files.
4. **Start the local server**: In the bottom right corner of the Visual Studio Code window, locate the "Go Live" text and click it. This will start the local server and automatically open the project in your default web browser.
5. **Test and execute**: Your default web browser will display the "Get Division Remainder By 2" application. Input a number in the text box provided, and the application will instantly show the division remainder (if you're using the first version) or whether the number is even or odd (if you're using the latest version).
6. **Stop the server**: To stop the local server, simply click the same corner where the port number is now displayed. The server will terminate, and the application will no longer be accessible through the browser.

Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" feature acts as a local server, providing an easy way to execute and test applications without any complications. Although mainly intended for developers, it proves to be an interesting and useful tool for running this particular application.

## Update History
### Part II
* Now, instead of displaying the division remainder, the application utilizes the result to determine whether the number is even or odd, displaying the information below the text box.

### Part I
* Release of the "Get Division Remainder By 2".
* The application only calculates the division remainder of any number by 2 and displays the result below the text box.
